# MyHordes Prime Archive

This folder contains an archived version of the closed-source code used on the official MyHordes server.

## Which code is archived here?

We regularly publish all closed-source code with a delay of one year. 
Therefore, what you see in this archive is the state of the closed-source plugin from one year ago.
Newer versions of the code are not publicly available until they reach an age of one year.

## Is the archived code compatible with the latest version of MyHordes?

No. The code in the archive is published here for transparency, but it very likely does not work with the latest version
of MyHordes. If you intend to run the plugin, we recommend checking out a version of MyHordes from a similar time.
Please keep in mind that the archive potentially contains code snapshots that were in the middle of active development,
it is therefore possible that it contains bugs or is not even able to run at all.

## How is the archive organized?

The actual plugin code is stored in sub-folders of the `seasons` directory. Each sub-folder represents the closed-source
code for a specific season (i.e. `s15` for Season 15).
Within these sub-folders you'll find a verbatim copy of the archived code as well as a file called 
`original_commit.txt`. This file is not part of the original code, but it contains meta-information about its state,
such as its date and latest commit message.
